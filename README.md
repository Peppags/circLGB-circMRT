## Content  
* **data**   
  **circLGB**: The **.bed** files for training and testing our circLGB model  
  **circMRT**: The **.bed (.fasta)** files for training and testing our circMRT model  
* **features**   
  **circLGB**: Sequence-derived features of the given sequences for circRNA identification    
  **circMRT**: Sequence-derived features of the query sequences for circRNA regulatory interactions prediction  
  feature_importance: Ranked feature list for circLGB and circMRT  
* **weights**   
  The well-trained weights for circLGB & circMRT models        
* **circLGB.py & circMRT.py**   
  The Python codes, they can be ran to reproduce our predictors results
* **result**     
  The prediction results of our predictors on the test data    
#### **Note:**    
  The **features/circLGB/test.csv** and **features/circMRT/test.csv** can replaced or modified to the sequence-derived features of interest for identifying circular RNA and predicting its regulatory interactions, respectively.
